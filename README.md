Hello There! My name is Kevin Ng.

I'm an exceptionally creative and reliable Software Engineer with a proven background in customer service and a driven work ethic. I'm a disciplined professional with a proven ability to deliver quality results while collaborating in a rapidly changing work environment meeting deadlines and expectations. I have a strong desire and willingness to learn.
