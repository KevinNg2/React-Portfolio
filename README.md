## React Portfolio
My name is Kevin Ng and I'm a web developer based in Orange County, California. Having spent a majority of my life in health and wellness, I've decided to shift gears into web design and technology. I'm an exceptionally creative and reliable Software Engineer with a proven background in customer service and a driven work ethic. I'm a disciplined professional with a proven ability to deliver quality results while collaborating in a rapidly changing work environment meeting deadlines and expectations. I have a strong desire and willingness to learn.

## Description
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This portfolio website is built with React. It is a fully interactive terminal inspired portfolio page. Highlights include: React, JSX, CSS, and Bootstrap. It features a single header component that navigates and renders out About, Projects, Contact, and Resume sections.
